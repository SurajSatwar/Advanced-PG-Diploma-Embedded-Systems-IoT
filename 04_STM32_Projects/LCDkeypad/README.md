LCD + Keypad Project
Project Overview

This project demonstrates interfacing a matrix keypad and an LCD display with an STM32 microcontroller. The keypad is used for user input, and the LCD shows the input or feedback. Useful for menu systems, data entry, or learning input/output with embedded systems.

Features

Read keys from a matrix keypad (e.g. 3×4 or 4×4)

Debounce keypad inputs

Display pressed key(s) on an LCD (16×2 or 20×4)

Clear or reset display based on keypad command

Cursor movement or basic control via keypad

Hardware Requirements

STM32 microcontroller (series/model as used in your board)

LCD module (e.g. HD44780-compatible)

Keypad (matrix type, e.g. 3×4 or 4×4)

Resistors / potentiometer (for LCD contrast)

Power supply (matching LCD & MCU voltage)

Wires, breadboard or PCB

Pin Connections
Component	Pin	Connected To (STM32)	Notes
LCD RS	Specify pin	Board pin number	Register select
LCD EN	Specify pin	Board pin number	Enable line
LCD D4–D7	Specify pins	Board pins	Data lines (if using 4-bit mode)
LCD VCC, VSS, V0			Power, ground, contrast
Keypad Rows	Specify each row	STM32 pins	For detecting row signals
Keypad Columns	Specify each column	STM32 pins	For detecting column signals

Adjust according to your setup.

Software / Libraries

Code written in C using STM32 HAL (or other library)

Keypad scanning logic with debounce

LCD driver component to initialize display, send commands, characters, strings

Main program loops waiting for keypad press, processing it, then sending to LCD

Usage Instructions

Wire up the LCD and keypad to the STM32 as per your pin configuration.

Ensure the MCU clock and peripheral (GPIO) configuration matches your hardware.

Compile and flash the firmware to the STM32 board.

On power-up, LCD initializes.

Press a key on the keypad:

The corresponding character appears on the LCD.

Special keys (if defined) clear the screen or reset cursor.

Troubleshooting

No input on LCD

Check power & contrast for the LCD

Check LCD initialization routine (proper delays, correct pin mode)

Keypad presses not detected

Verify row/column pins correctly wired

Ensure pull-ups or pull-downs are correctly configured

Debounce time sufficient

Wrong characters / display issues

Check 4-bit vs 8-bit mode configuration

Confirm correct sequence of LCD commands

Example Enhancements

Add support for special keys (e.g. ‘*’, ‘#’) to serve functions (e.g. clear, backspace)

Create a user menu navigated via keypad

Store input strings and send them via UART or another interface
