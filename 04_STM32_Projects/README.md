# STM32 Projects  
*(Part of Advanced PG Diploma – Embedded Systems & IoT)*  

## Overview  
This folder contains projects developed for the **STM32** microcontroller family. These projects cover GPIO, UART, timers, PWM, ADC, interrupts, and interfacing with external peripherals using STM32 HAL libraries.

## Tools & Requirements  
- **IDE / Compiler:** STM32CubeIDE or Keil µVision  
- **Programmer/Debugger:** ST-LINK, SWD, or JTAG  
- **Target Board:** STM32 Nucleo or Discovery board  
- **Optional Tool:** STM32CubeMX for pin and peripheral configuration  

## Build & Flash Instructions  
1. Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.  
2. Build the project to generate the binary.  
3. Flash the firmware to the STM32 board using ST-LINK.  
4. Connect required peripherals as per each project.  
5. Run and test the project.
