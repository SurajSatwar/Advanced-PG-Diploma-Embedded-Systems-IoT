üîå ESP32 Smart Switch using Sinric Pro
üìò Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a relay (or any electronic appliance) remotely using the ESP32 and Sinric Pro IoT platform. The device connects to Wi-Fi and allows control through the Sinric Pro mobile app or voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant.

üß† Features

Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi and Sinric Pro cloud.

Control a relay (ON/OFF) using Sinric Pro mobile app or Alexa/Google.

Real-time synchronization between device and app.

Works even after reconnection or reboot.

üîë Sinric Pro Setup

Go to Sinric Pro Dashboard
.

Create a new Switch device.

Copy the Device ID, App Key, and App Secret.

Replace these values in the Arduino code:

#define APP_KEY "your_app_key_here"
#define APP_SECRET "your_app_secret_here"
#define SWITCH_ID "your_device_id_here"


Use the Sinric Pro mobile app to link and control your device.

üíª Arduino Code Explanation
1. Libraries Used
#include <WiFi.h>
#include "SinricPro.h"
#include "SinricProSwitch.h"


WiFi.h ‚Üí Handles Wi-Fi connection.

SinricPro.h ‚Üí Core library for Sinric Pro IoT platform.

SinricProSwitch.h ‚Üí Provides support for switch-type devices.

2. Wi-Fi Connection
WiFi.begin(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS);
while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
  delay(250);
}


This code connects your ESP32 to your home Wi-Fi network.

3. Sinric Pro Device Setup
SinricProSwitch& mySwitch = SinricPro[SWITCH_ID];
mySwitch.onPowerState(onPowerState);
SinricPro.begin(APP_KEY, APP_SECRET);


Registers your device and defines the behavior when ON/OFF commands are received.

4. Relay Control Callback
bool onPowerState(const String &deviceId, bool &state) {
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, state);
  return true;
}


Turns the relay ON when the state is true, and OFF when false.

üì≤ Usage

Upload the code to your ESP32 using Arduino IDE.

Open the Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to see connection logs.

Once connected, open the Sinric Pro App ‚Üí Tap the switch ‚Üí The relay toggles ON/OFF.

You can also control it using Alexa or Google Assistant (link Sinric Pro skill/service).

üß™ Example Output (Serial Monitor)
Connecting to WiFi...
Connected to WiFi
Connected to Sinric Pro
Switch toggled ON
Switch toggled OFF

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

Make sure the relay module operates safely (use opto-isolated type for AC loads).

Double-check your wiring to avoid short circuits.

Use a 5V power supply for stable operation.
