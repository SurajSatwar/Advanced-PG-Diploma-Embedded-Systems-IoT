## Description

- **BTN1 Pressed**: LED1 blinks slowly (500ms ON/OFF).
- **BTN2 Pressed**: LED1 blinks fast (250ms), then LED2 blinks slowly.
- **BTN3 Pressed**: LED1, LED2, and LED3 blink in increasing speed pattern.
- **No Button Pressed**: All LEDs are OFF.

## Components

- Microcontroller: AT89C51 / 8051
- 3 LEDs (connected to P1.0, P1.1, P1.2)
- 3 Push Buttons (connected to P2.0, P2.1, P2.2)
